The project is set up to work locally, please note that if you want to make it work globally, you will need to change the configuration of the client.

Communicate with other users through virtual chat rooms with our messaging program. With the following options available:

--- Create Room ---
Create your own personalized chat room and invite others to join.

--- Join Room ---
Search for and join existing chat rooms created by other users.

--- Exit Application ---
Log out and close the application.

Additionally, we offer two messaging options:

Send encrypted messages for added security and privacy.

--- Non-Encrypted Messages ---
Send regular, non-encrypted messages.

Our messaging program provides users with a convenient and secure way to communicate with each other, with a range of options to suit their needs.
